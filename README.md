Introduction
This project demonstrates feature extraction using Zernike moments in MATLAB. Zernike moments are widely used in image processing for characterizing shapes and patterns, especially in applications requiring rotation-invariant feature extraction.

The repository includes MATLAB scripts to compute Zernike moments for a given image, and extract features useful for pattern recognition, object detection, and other image analysis tasks.

Features
Zernike Moment Calculation: Compute Zernike moments for images to extract rotation-invariant features.
Feature Extraction: Generate a set of features from images for further analysis or classification.
Visualization: Visualize the Zernike moments to understand the feature representation.


Installation
To run the project, you'll need to have MATLAB installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the project:

Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/RudraPratap24/Zernike_Moment-MATLAB-
cd zernike-moment-feature-extraction
Install necessary MATLAB toolboxes (if required).

Usage
Prepare your image data by placing them in the images/ directory.

Run the main script to compute Zernike moments and extract features:

matlab
Copy code
run main.m
The script will output the Zernike moments and corresponding features, which can be used for further analysis.

Examples
Watch matching_2_img.m
